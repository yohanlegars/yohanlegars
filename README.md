### Hi Folks ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently learning probabilistic models and motion planning for robotics.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m looking for an internship in the field of robotics and/or AI. 

ðŸ’¿ I am interested to find ways to scale down heavy deep learning models and run them on microcontrollers with little RAM.
