### Hi Folks ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently learning Artificial Intelligence techniques and motion planning for robotics.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m looking for an internship in the field of robotics and/or AI. 

ðŸ¦¾ When I find some time, I like to build some mechatronics projects with arduino, raspberry pi or jeston nano.

ðŸ’¿ I am interested to find ways to scale down heavy deep learning models and run them on low RAM microcontrollers.
